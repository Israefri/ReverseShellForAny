# ReverseShellForAny
This is a reverse shell that would work on any os just implement the client in the target machine
this reverse shell opening a socket throug port 6969 (Funny Number :P) 
and fixing the problem of cd (cause cd problematic because the session of the reverse shell runnig inside the current dir and you need to change the session for 
this command to run)
the reverse shell would work with any major OS cause it using the matual things between them.
